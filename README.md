# Android_OMDB_search
A very simple yet powerful app to search through Open Movie Data Base. OMDB uses IMDB for the data but OMDB is free
and provides simple API.

## Features
- Search

- Remove movie/show from search result

#Following is a list of what libraries I have used to make this app:
- Uses MVVM + clean architecture
- Uses Android Jetpack, Material Design Guidelines, AndroidX Support libraries and AndroidX testing specifications
- Room for local database
- Networking tasks was done by Retrofit, Coroutines and Glide
- Testing was done using Espresso and Junit
- Supports system theme (Light + Dark theme)
